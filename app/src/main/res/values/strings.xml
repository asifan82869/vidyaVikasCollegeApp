    <string name="about_text">
        It was in 1974 that after a long process of reclaiming the waste land in Kannamwar Nagar, Vikhroli,
        the foundation was laid for the present building of the institution.
        Planted in one room at Pantnagar, Ghatkopar, this tree of Knowledge has grown up with the following
        24 branches of education.
        With an objective of holding light to those in darkness and extending support to helpless and guide
        those who have lost direction, our kind hearted, socially concerned and dedicated reformers laid down
        the foundation of Vidya Vikas Education Society in 1962, to impart higher education to the masses,
        especially,the weaker and underprivileged sections of society. Late Dr. W.S. Matkar, Ex. MLA.,
        Maharashtra State, Late Dr. Datta Samant, Renowned Trade Unionist and Ex. MP, Union of India and
        Shri P.M. Raut, Recipient of the National Award for Teaching and present secretary of the institution
        are the founder members of the institution. The institution could reach a remarkable milestone in the
        field of education in a very short span of time. Started with an initial strength of 260students, it
        has now grown up both qualitatively and quantitatively in to 19 educational units imparting knowledge
        to more than 15,000 students from KG level to PG level.
        All the members of Vidya Vikas Education Society family are fortunate to be guided and supported in
        their mission of education by Shri P.M. Raut, Secretary, Vidya Vikas Education Society and Mrs. Vidya
        P.Raut, Chief Executive Officer of the institution, both being the recipient of the National Award for
